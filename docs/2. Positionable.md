# Positionable

A minimal interface for anything that has a position in world units.

---
## Overview

It acts as a contract for the camera system: if your entity implements `Positionable`, the camera can follow it.  

Typical examples: player characters, NPCs, projectiles, or interactive objects.  

> **Note:** Coordinates are expressed in **world units**. Conversion to pixels happens inside `Camera`.

## Definition

```java
public interface Positionable
{
    float getX();
    float getY();
}
```

---
## Example

```java
// Creating a Player class that implements Positionable
public class Player implements Positionable
{
    private float x, y;

	// Getters for coordinates
    @Override
    public float getX() { return x; }

    @Override
    public float getY() { return y; }
}
```

```java
// Hooking the Player into JCamera
Player player = new Player();
Camera playerCamera = new Camera(0, 0, 20, 15);
CameraFollower playerCameraFollower = 
	new CameraFollower(playerCamera, player, 5f, true);
```
